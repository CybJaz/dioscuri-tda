	shorttitle = {Knot invariants and their relations},
	abstract = {This work brings methods from topological data analysis to knot theory and develops new data analysis tools inspired by this application. We explore a vast collection of knot invariants and relations between then using Mapper and Ball Mapper algorithms. In particular, we develop versions of the Ball Mapper algorithm that incorporate symmetries and other relations within the data, and provide ways to compare data arising from different descriptors, such as knot invariants. Additionally, we extend the Mapper construction to the case where the range of the lens function is high dimensional rather than a 1-dimensional space, that also provides ways of visualizing functions between high-dimensional spaces. We illustrate the use of these techniques on knot theory data and draw attention to potential implications of our findings in knot theory.},

	abstract = {Oxford {COVID}-19 Database ({OxCOVID}19 Database) is a comprehensive source of information related to the {COVID}-19 pandemic. This relational database contains time-series data on epidemiology, government responses, mobility, weather and more across time and space for all countries at the national level, and for more than 50 countries at the regional level. It is curated from a variety of (wherever available) official sources. Its purpose is to facilitate the analysis of the spread of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 virus and to assess the effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions to reduce the impact of the pandemic. Our database is a freely available, daily updated tool that provides unified and granular information across geographical regions.Design {typeData} integration {objectiveMeasurement}(s)Coronavirus infectious disease, viral {epidemiologyTechnology} type(s)Digital {curationFactor} types(s)Sample characteristic(s)Homo sapiens},
